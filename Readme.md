# Dance Move Predicter

Give the model some music to get all your dance steps choreographed by us automatically. :)

## Model

Uses a single LSTM-RNN layer on RAW audio wav files to classify a window of time to a dance step.

## Usage

* Training script - `dance.py`
* Eval script - `dance_eval.py`
* A GUI for visualizing the moves synchronized with the song playing - `g.py`
